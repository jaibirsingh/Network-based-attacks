## Commands
* `tshark -v`
* `tshark -h`
* `tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap`  --> This is the equivalent of what Wireshark does with a GUI
* **What is pcap**
  * In the context of tshark, which is a command-line network protocol analyzer, "pcap" refers to Packet Capture (PCAP) files.
  * PCAP is a file format used to store network traffic captured by tools like Wireshark or tcpdump.
  * These files contain packets of data that have been intercepted and recorded from a live network or from a specific network interface.
  * `tshark` is capable of reading and analyzing PCAP files.
  * It can dissect the captured packets, display information about various protocols, filter  packets based on specific criteria, and perform various analysis tasks on the captured network traffic contained within the PCAP file.
 
* You can use `tshark` to count the total number of packets in the "HTTP_traffic.pcap" file by using the `-r` flag to specify the input file and applying a filter to count all packets. Here's the command:

```bash
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap | wc -l
```

This command will read the "HTTP_traffic.pcap" file with `tshark` and then count the lines (which correspond to packets) using `wc -l`, providing you with the total number of packets in the file.

If you specifically want to count only HTTP packets, you can filter by the HTTP protocol:

```bash
tshark -r HTTP_traffic.pcap -Y "http" | wc -l
```

This command filters only the HTTP packets from the "HTTP_traffic.pcap" file and then counts the number of lines (packets) using `wc -l`.
