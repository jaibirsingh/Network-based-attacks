* What is a network-based attack?
  * Generally speaking, any attack that is not done by using a vulnerability in an operating system, rather on a network.

* What are the major network services can be exploited?
  * ARP
  * DHCP
  * SMB
  * FTP
  * Telnet
  * SSH
 
## Man-in-the-middle attack
  * Basically hearing the newtork traffic
  * Victim 1 <---> {Attacker} Switch {Attacker} <------> Victim 2

* How can we hear to the network traffic
  1. Promiscuous mode --> Listen to all the traffic
  2. Poisoning --> Eg: ARP poisoning --> Spoofing MAC addresses --> Traffic intended for some other device is routed to our device

* Use Wireshark to monitor and analyze the network traffic.
  * To capture traffic on a network, what is the first setting to check in wireshark before beginning the capture? The interface
  * Which Statistic page breaks down the protocols found in the packet capture? Protocol Hierarchy 

* **Extrazz**
  * `nmap [IP] -sn` --> What is the significance of -sn?
    * It tells Nmap to perform a scan without port scanning, focusing solely on determining which hosts are online or reachable on the network by sending ICMP echo requests, TCP SYN packets, or other probe types, depending on the privileges of the user.
    * This scan is also known as a "ping sweep" and is used to identify active devices on a network without scanning specific ports. It's a quick way to determine the status (online/offline) of hosts in a network.
